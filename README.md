# MCGalaxy-stuff
A place where I keep all my "custom" MCGalaxy commands/plugins
| Name  | Function |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| +inv  | A plugin that disables /invincible unless the map's motd contains "+inv."  (Edit of Unk's NoTP)|
| lesspainfulrainbow | An edit of Unk's Rainbow.cs that changes color less often. |
| NoTP | A plugin that disables /tp if hax is disabled, and it's bypassed if you're on your realm or a staff member. (Edit of tyhender's GateKeeper)|
| CmdFakePay  | A command that makes it look like you paid someone money.  (Edit of derekdinan's FakeGive)|
| CmdGtfo | A command that blacklists people from a map, undoes their changes, warns them, and sends them a message in their inbox. (coded from scratch!) |
| CmdShortname | A command that lets people set their nick to part of their actual name. They can also add an optional flair before it. (coded from scratch!) |
